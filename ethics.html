          <h2>General Ethical Principles</h2>
          
          <p class="justify-text">As a student and aspiring computing professional, I am committed to contributing to society and human well-being, recognizing that all 
            people are stakeholders in computing. My work aims to improve the quality of life for all individuals, promoting fundamental human rights 
            and protecting each person's right to autonomy. I strive to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to health, 
            safety, personal security, and privacy, and prioritize the needs of those less advantaged when interests conflict. 
            Transparency and accountability are core values in my work, and I am dedicated to being honest about my capabilities, limitations, 
            and the potential impacts of my projects. Respecting the privacy of individuals and organizations is fundamental to my ethical practice, 
            ensuring that data is collected, used, and stored responsibly. Additionally, I honor the confidentiality of information entrusted to me, 
            whether it pertains to individuals, organizations, or projects, as maintaining trust is essential in all professional relationships.</p>
